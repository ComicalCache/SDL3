# SDL3

Playing around with SDL3 as first attempt to get into graphics programming. The project can be built with `make`, ran with `make run` and cleaned with `make clean`. 
> `SDL3` and `SDL3_image` are required. The library path in the `Makefile` and include paths in the `Makefile` and `.clangd` file may need to be updated.
